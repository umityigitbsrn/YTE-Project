## TÜBİTAK YTE Project

The aim of this project was creating a web application which allows us to manage events that are created by
some institution users by using React and Java Spring. In this project institution user can create an event with
name, starting date, end date, and quota; update and delete this event and get information about users which
enrolled to this event with bar charts. Also, the users, who want to see all events and enroll events which users
want to, can list all activities and enroll them. <br />

In this project all transferred object validations are set in the backend side.
